# Notes

## AI Usage

Eric Wastl specifically states:

> **Should I use AI to solve Advent of Code puzzles?** No. If you send a friend to the gym on your behalf, would you expect to get stronger? Advent of Code puzzles are designed to be interesting for humans to solve - no consideration is made for whether AI can or cannot solve a puzzle. If you want practice prompting an AI, there are almost certainly better exercises elsewhere designed with that in mind.

Despite that, I am likely going to use (and in fact already have used) AI in limited capacities.

Things I will definitely **not** be doing:

- throwing the problem description into an LLM and see what pops out
- coding with inline LLM completion/suggestions enabled

Things I'll consider doing:

- asking Copilot about a platform specific API for reading a file instead of / in addition to looking at the docs myself
- after defining a method's API and hand-writing a few test cases, asking for a few more test cases
- use AI to help sort through TypeScript type errors or help me realize my vision for a more expressive type declaration

Things I'll definitely do (after using AI):

- read all the code; understand all the code
- rewrite/refine any code that doesn't feel like something I'd write
